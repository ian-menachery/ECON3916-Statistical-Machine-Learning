# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

> *Bridging Traditional Economics with Modern Machine Learning*

## About This Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an undergraduate economics student exploring the intersection of **causal inference** and **predictive analytics** through the lens of data science.

This repository showcases my work from **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to extend foundational economic and statistical concepts into the machine learning domain. Rather than treating these fields as separate, I'm discovering how techniques like Lasso Regression, Random Forests, and Neural Networks can complement traditional econometric approaches to answer both *"what will happen?"* and *"why does it happen?"*

My goal is to develop a toolkit that combines:
- 📈 **Economic Theory** – Understanding mechanisms, incentives, and causal relationships
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** – Leveraging algorithms for prediction, classification, and pattern recognition
- 📉 **Statistical Rigor** – Ensuring models are interpretable, validated, and actionable

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis**, **Economic Consulting**, and **Finance** where I can apply these skills to real-world problems.

## 🎯 Learning Approach

This course follows a **"Concept Extension"** methodology:
1. **Start** with a foundational statistical concept (e.g., Linear Regression)
2. **Extend** it using scalable ML algorithms (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
3. **Apply** these tools to economic problems like demand forecasting, policy evaluation, and market analysis
4. **Validate** results with economic intuition and statistical testing
