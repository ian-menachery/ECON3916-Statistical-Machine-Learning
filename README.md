# ECON3916-Statistical-Machine-Learning 
📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Bridging Traditional Economics with Modern Machine Learning


About This Portfolio
Welcome! I'm an undergraduate economics student exploring the intersection of causal inference and predictive analytics through the lens of data science.
This repository showcases my work from ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics, where I'm learning to extend foundational economic and statistical concepts into the machine learning domain. Rather than treating these fields as separate, I'm discovering how techniques like Lasso Regression, Random Forests, and Neural Networks can complement traditional econometric approaches to answer both "what will happen?" and "why does it happen?"
My goal is to develop a toolkit that combines:

📈 Economic Theory – Understanding mechanisms, incentives, and causal relationships
🤖 Machine Learning – Leveraging algorithms for prediction, classification, and pattern recognition
📉 Statistical Rigor – Ensuring models are interpretable, validated, and actionable

I'm actively seeking opportunities in Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance where I can apply these skills to real-world problems.

🎯 Learning Approach
This course follows a "Concept Extension" methodology:

Start with a foundational statistical concept (e.g., Linear Regression)
Extend it using scalable ML algorithms (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
Apply these tools to economic problems like demand forecasting, policy evaluation, and market analysis
Validate results with economic intuition and statistical testing


🚀 What I'm Working On

Applying regularization techniques to high-dimensional economic data
Building predictive models for economic indicators
Exploring causal inference with machine learning methods
Developing interpretable models for policy recommendations
